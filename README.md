# 🎨 Image Color Classification

This project uses machine learning to predict the **dominant color** in an image from **8 predefined color categories** using a trained SVM model.

## 🧠 How It Works

- Upload an image (JPG, JPEG, or PNG).
- The image is processed using **OpenCV** to extract features.
- A trained **SVM (Support Vector Machine)** model predicts the dominant color from the 8 categories.
- Built with **Streamlit** for an interactive web interface.
